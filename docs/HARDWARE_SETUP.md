## üîß Detailed Wiring

### Bluetooth Module (HC-05/HC-06)
```
HC-05/HC-06 Module:
VCC  ‚ûú  Arduino 5V
GND  ‚ûú  Arduino GND
TXD  ‚ûú  Arduino Pin 2 (RX)
RXD  ‚ûú  Arduino Pin 3 (TX)
```

**Note**: Some HC-05 modules operate at 3.3V. If your module is 3.3V, use a voltage divider or level shifter for the RX pin.

### Servo Motor Connection
```
Servo Motor:
Red Wire (VCC)    ‚ûú  Arduino 5V
Brown Wire (GND)  ‚ûú  Arduino GND
Orange Wire (SIG) ‚ûú  Arduino Pin 9
```

### Temperature Sensor (LM35)
```
LM35 Temperature Sensor:
Pin 1 (VCC) ‚ûú  Arduino 5V
Pin 2 (OUT) ‚ûú  Arduino A1
Pin 3 (GND) ‚ûú  Arduino GND
```

### Battery Monitoring Circuit
```
Battery Voltage Divider:
Battery (+) ‚ûú 10kŒ© ‚ûú Arduino A0 ‚ûú 10kŒ© ‚ûú GND
```

This creates a 50% voltage divider to safely monitor battery voltage.

## üîã Power Supply Considerations

### For Development
- Use USB power from computer
- Arduino Mega draws ~50mA
- Additional components add ~100mA total

### For Portable Operation
- Use 7-12V battery pack connected to Arduino power jack
- Or use 5V power bank with USB cable
- Ensure sufficient current capacity (500mA minimum)

### Battery Monitoring
- Use voltage divider to monitor battery level
- Calibrate the readings in software
- Set low battery warning threshold

## üì° Bluetooth Module Configuration

### HC-05 Setup (if needed)
```
AT Commands (connect at 38400 baud):
AT+NAME=SmartBag        // Set device name
AT+PSWD=1234           // Set pairing password
AT+UART=9600,0,0       // Set baud rate to 9600
```

### HC-06 Setup (if needed)
```
AT Commands (connect at 9600 baud):
AT+NAMESmartBag        // Set device name
AT+PIN1234             // Set pairing password
```

## üß™ Testing the Hardware

### Basic Power Test
1. Connect Arduino to USB
2. Upload a simple LED blink sketch
3. Verify Pin 13 LED blinks

### Bluetooth Test
1. Upload Arduino code
2. Open Serial Monitor at 9600 baud
3. Look for "Smart Bag Controller Initialized"
4. Check if Bluetooth module is discoverable

### Sensor Test
1. Monitor battery and temperature readings in Serial Monitor
2. Verify values are reasonable
3. Test servo movement with manual commands

### Integration Test
1. Pair mobile device with Bluetooth module
2. Connect with the mobile app
3. Test all functions: umbrella control, sensor readings, SMS setup

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Bluetooth Not Working
- Check wiring connections
- Verify baud rate (9600)
- Ensure module is powered
- Try AT commands to test module

### Servo Not Moving
- Check power supply (servo needs adequate current)
- Verify signal wire connection to Pin 9
- Test with simple servo sweep code

### Temperature Reading Wrong
- Check LM35 orientation
- Verify 5V power supply
- Check analog pin connection
- Calibrate if necessary

### Battery Reading Incorrect
- Verify voltage divider resistor values

- Calibrate in software

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Notes

1. **Power Supply**: Don't exceed Arduino voltage ratings
2. **Current Draw**: Ensure power supply can handle total current
3. **Connections**: Double-check all wiring before powering on
